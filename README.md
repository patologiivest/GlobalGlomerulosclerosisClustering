# Exemplary code for clustering of global glomerulosclerosis

<img src="docs/Clustering.png" align="center" height="300px"/>

## Abstract

The classification between globally sclerosed and non-globally sclerosed glomeruli represents one of the most basic distinctions among glomerular lesions. The current project illustrates that such a distinction can to a large extent be achieved via clustering with pretrained convolutional neural networks without the need for any fine-tuning or training on glomerular images.

## Code

Exemplary code is made available via a Jupyter Notebook, which runs stain normalization of glomerular images, extracts image features using a convolutional neural network, runs Leiden clustering, computes the adjusted Rand index between cluster and class labels, and plots the feature embedding and clustering results.

## Data

The code snippet is based on glomeruli extracted from a set of kidney whole slide images published by [Bueno et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920302080), available and reused under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence ([CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)). The whole slide images were obtained from [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/k7nvtgn2x6/3).
